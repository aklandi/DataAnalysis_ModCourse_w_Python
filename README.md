# Data Analysis with Python

This repository stores copies of Jupyter notebooks, slides, and data that are used for a half-semester course on data anaylsis with Python.  These materials are based on the online textbook available at https://wesmckinney.com/book. 

**For Fall 2023**

The following schedule should be used as a guide for keeping in time for turning work in.  This is a self-paced class for the most part, however, and the notebooks are meant to be interactive --- you should be filling in blanks in the text and in the code, and answering questions throughout each notebook. There is an associated Google Classroom on which I will provide feedback and grades for the completed notebooks.
